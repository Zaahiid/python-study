## Chapter 1: Introduction

Python is a popular high-level programming language that was created by Guido van Rossum in 1991. It is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. 

Python supports modules and packages, which encourages program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in source or binary form for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.

Some of the notable features of Python that make it highly popular are:

- It has a very clear and readable syntax which makes it easy to learn
- It is open source, portable and can run on Mac, Windows, Linux and more
- Python has a large and expansive standard library
- It is a versatile language that supports tools for a wide range of use cases including - web development, data analysis, artificial intelligence, scientific computing and more
- Python supports several programming paradigms like object oriented, imperative, functional and procedural programming styles
- It has automatic memory management and dynamic features that make coding in Python easier and concise
- There is a massive community support for Python and vast collection of open source libraries and tools available for programmers

Python powers many applications across fields like software, web and internet development, education, scientific and numeric computing and more.  Some popular companies using Python include Google, Facebook, Instagram, Spotify, Quora and Netflix among others. With major growth in fields like data science and machine learning, Python is going to continue to grow as the preferred choice of programmers for years to come.
